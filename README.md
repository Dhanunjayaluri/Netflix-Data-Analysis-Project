# Netflix - Data Exploration and Visualization

## Business Problem

The objective of this project is to analyze the provided Netflix dataset and generate insights that can help Netflix make informed decisions about the types of shows/movies to produce and how to grow their business in different countries.

## Dataset

You can access the dataset [here](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/000/940/original/netflix.csv). Also you can find the csv file in the repo.

## Project Goals

Our exploration will aim to address the following questions:

- A comparison of TV shows vs. movies.
- What is the best time to launch a TV show?
- Analysis of actors/directors in different types of shows/movies.
- Does Netflix have more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years?
- Understanding what content is available in different countries.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
